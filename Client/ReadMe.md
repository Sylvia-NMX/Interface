# Installation Guide for the Client Data Visualization Interface

## Disclaimer: 
This repository contains the un-built version of the app which means that this version will only work on localhost. The backend is no longer operable due to the fact that the connection to the corresponding database is made by an event with the submit button and it is connected through an api deployed in a virtual server. The backend folder is left as a version control and for future references if needed. The built version will have changes in connection and security which is why it is recommened to use this repository as a consultation resource.
